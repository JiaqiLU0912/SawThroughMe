## Description

"All stable processes we shall predict. All unstable processes we shall control."

— John von Neumann

"The tactics of appropriation have been co-opted. Illegal action has become advertisement. Protest has become cliché. Revolt has become passé. These disputes are the usual suspects. Having accepted these failures to some degree, we can now attempt to define a parasitic tactical response. We need to invent a practice that allows invisible subversion. We need to feed and grow inside existing communication systems while contributing nothing to their survival; we need to become parasites."

— Nathan Martin, Parasitic Media: Creating Invisible Slicing Parasites and Other Forms of Tactical Augmentation
